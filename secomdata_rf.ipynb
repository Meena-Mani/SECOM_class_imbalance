    "<h3>I. Introduction</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SECOM dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SECOM) in the  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml) is semicondutor manufacturing data. There are 1567 records, 590 anonymized features and 104 fails. This makes it an imbalanced dataset with a 14:1 ratio of pass to fails. The process yield has a simple pass/fail response (encoded -1/1).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Objective</h4>\n",
    "We consider some of the different approaches to classify imbalanced data. In previous exercises we looked at the [one-class SVM](https://github.com/Meena-Mani/SECOM_class_imbalance/blob/master/secomdata_ocsvm.ipynb) and [SVM+oversampling using SMOTE](https://github.com/Meena-Mani/SECOM_class_imbalance/blob/master/secomdata_svm_smote.ipynb). In this exercise we consider the Random Forest (RF) classifier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The RF classifier is an ensemble method that has been shown to perform very well. A 2014 paper compared 179 classifiers on 121 data sets in the UCI repository and found that the RF was the most accurate classifier overall <a href=\"#ref1\">[1]</a>.  The algorithm has been designed with the assumption that the classes are equally balanced. With imbalanced data, however, the overall error rate and prediction accuracy is skewed to the majority class. To correct for this, two strategies are available for highly imbalanced classes:  \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> cost sensitive learning (penalizing misclassification of the minority class)\n",
    "<li> resampling to balance the classes\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the first of these by reweighting the observations. The two classes will be weighted in inverse proportion to their respective class frequencies so that a heavier penalty is assigned to the misclassification of the minority class. The class weights are incorporated into the RF algorithm in two places. The first is to weight the gini criterion when splitting the data; the second is to weight the majority vote in the terminal nodes which is then aggregated for the final prediction.\n",
    " \n",
    "<h4>Methodology</h4>\n",
    "There are two parameters in the *sklearn* [Random Forest Classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) module to weight the classes. These are `class_weight` and\n",
    "`sample_weight`. The RF is an ensemble of decision trees, so these options have been derived from the [implementions for the decision tree](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the following:\n",
    "- Baseline case (where the RF has equal weights)\n",
    "- Class weights (in inverse proportion to the class frequencies)\n",
    "- Sample weights (in inverse proportion to the class frequencies)\n",
    "- Matthews correlation coefficient as a score\n",
    "- Efficacy of the OOB estimate and CV to select class weights\n",
    "- ROC curves\n",
    "- Performance of parsimonious models \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Preprocessing</h4>\n",
    "The Random Forest (RF) classifier can handle continuous and categorical varibles and does not require transformations or preprocessing such as one-hot encoding or scaling. The only preprocessing needed is with regards to the missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this data set, the measurements come from a large number of processes or sensors and many of the records are missing. In addition some measurements are identical/constant and so not useful for prediction. We will remove the columns that have high missing counts or constant values and estimate values for the rest of the missing data. These are the same steps used for the [one-class SVM](https://github.com/Meena-Mani/SECOM_class_imbalance/blob/master/secomdata_ocsvm.ipynb) and a more detailed explanation can be seen there. "

The RF variable importance can rank features in order of importance and in the [One-class SVM](https://github.com/Meena-Mani/SECOM_class_imbalance/blob/master/secomdata_ocsvm.ipynb) exercise, we saw that some of the RF features had a variable importance score of zero. In this section, we will compute the MCC for RF models where for each subsequent model, the number of features (included in order of rank) is incremented. "

    "From the plot we see that the MCC score of 0.236 stabilizes after n = 180 (<i>n</i> is the number of features used). The variation we see beyond that can be attributed to the inherent variability in the RF runs. One of the characteristics of the random forest algorithm is that it performs well even with a large number of features and we see that using a larger number of variables does not impair the RF performance in our experiments either."

The SVM combined with a sampling strategy holds promise and we  will next look at a combination of oversampling (the minority class) and undersampling (the majority class)."
